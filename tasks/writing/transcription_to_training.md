# Transcription to Training Material Converter

## Context
This prompt transforms raw transcriptions of presentations, lectures, or discussions into structured, educational training materials. It's ideal for instructional designers, educators, and content developers who need to repurpose existing content into more formal learning resources.

   - Executive summary (1 paragraph overview)
   - Main content (with headers, bullet points, and examples)
   - Knowledge check questions (3-5 questions with answers)
   - Action items or next steps

4. Enhance clarity by:
   - Removing filler words, repetitions, and tangential content
   - Converting casual language into professional terminology where appropriate
   - Expanding on abbreviated concepts that need more explanation

5. Format the output using appropriate headers, bullet points, and emphasis for readability.

The training material should maintain the expertise level of the original content while making it more structured and actionable for learners.
