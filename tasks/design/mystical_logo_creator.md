# Mystical Logo Creator

## Context
Use this prompt when creating logos or icons for spiritual, mystical, or metaphysical businesses that need to balance multiple service offerings while maintaining an elegant, professional appearance.

## Prompt Content
Create a mystical and elegant logo/icon for `{BUSINESS_NAME}`, a website offering `{PRIMARY_SERVICE}` and `{SECONDARY_SERVICE}`. The design should embody the following elements and concepts:

**Central Element:** A stylized `{CENTRAL_SYMBOL}`, subtly transforming into `{TRANSFORMATION_ELEMENT}` to represent both aspects of the services.

**Cosmic Theme:** Incorporate `{COSMIC_ELEMENTS}` to reflect the `{BACKGROUND_THEME}` and the cosmic nature of the work.

**Color Palette:** Use `{PRIMARY_COLORS}` and `{ACCENT_COLORS}`. These colors should evoke a sense of `{DESIRED_MOOD}`.

**Typography (if included):** Choose a font that balances readability with a touch of mysticism. Consider `{FONT_STYLE}` for "`{BUSINESS_NAME}`".

**Sacred Geometry:** Subtly integrate sacred geometric shapes (like `{GEOMETRIC_ELEMENTS}`) into the background or as part of the main design to symbolize spiritual wisdom.

**Transformative Elements:** Include a subtle gradient or morphing effect to represent the transformative nature of the services and creations.

**Balancing Act:** Ensure the design is equally representative of both `{PRIMARY_SERVICE}` and `{SECONDARY_SERVICE}` without favoring one over the other.

**Scalability:** The design should be recognizable and effective at various sizes, from a small favicon to a larger header logo.

**Mood:** The overall feel should be `{OVERALL_MOOD}`, reflecting expertise and the unique nature of the offerings.

**Optional Elements:** Consider incorporating `{OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS}` to represent custom creations.

**Style Notes:**
- Aim for a clean, modern mystical look rather than an overly busy or cluttered design
- The icon should work well against both light and dark backgrounds, considering `{BACKGROUND_CONTEXT}`
- Avoid overtly religious symbols to maintain a broad spiritual appeal

## Parameters
- `{BUSINESS_NAME}`: The name of the business or website
- `{PRIMARY_SERVICE}`: Main service offered (e.g., "tarot readings")
- `{SECONDARY_SERVICE}`: Secondary service offered (e.g., "custom spiritual creations")
- `{CENTRAL_SYMBOL}`: Main symbolic element (e.g., "tarot card")
- `{TRANSFORMATION_ELEMENT}`: Element showing transformation (e.g., "handcrafted item like jewelry or guitar pick")
- `{COSMIC_ELEMENTS}`: Space-related design elements (e.g., "star-like elements or constellations")
- `{BACKGROUND_THEME}`: Website background description (e.g., "starry background of the website")
- `{PRIMARY_COLORS}`: Main color scheme (e.g., "deep purples, midnight blues")
- `{ACCENT_COLORS}`: Accent colors (e.g., "silver or gold accents")
- `{DESIRED_MOOD}`: Emotional tone (e.g., "mystery and elegance")
- `{FONT_STYLE}`: Typography style (e.g., "elegant serif or modern, slightly ornate sans-serif font")
- `{GEOMETRIC_ELEMENTS}`: Sacred geometry shapes (e.g., "Flower of Life or spiral")
- `{OVERALL_MOOD}`: Complete emotional atmosphere (e.g., "mystical, inviting, and professionally crafted")
- `{OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS}`: Additional symbolic elements (e.g., "subtle nod to repurposed materials")
- `{BACKGROUND_CONTEXT}`: Website background details (e.g., "charcoal overlay and starry background")
