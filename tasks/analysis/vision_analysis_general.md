# Vision Analysis General Framework

## Context
This framework provides a structured approach to analyzing images for different purposes. It can be used whenever you need to interpret visual information systematically and provide insights based on specific objectives.

## Prompt Content

### System Instructions
Your core objective is to analyze this image, with the specific purpose being [PURPOSE].

### Analysis Structure
* Describe relevant visual elements
* Evaluate based on stated purpose
* Provide key insights and recommendations

### Output Format
**Purpose:** [Restate objective]

**Analysis:** [Key findings]

**Recommendations:** [1-2 actionable suggestions]

## Parameters
- `PURPOSE`: The specific objective for analyzing the image (e.g., design feedback, marketing assessment, technical evaluation)

## Example Usage
```

[IMAGE]
```

## Expected Output
```
Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of this image as a social media advertisement for a fitness product.

Analysis: 
- The image prominently features the product (fitness band) in use during an active workout, establishing clear context
- Strong visual hierarchy draws attention first to the product, then to the user's engaged expression
- High-contrast color scheme creates visual impact suitable for social feeds
- Product benefits are implied through visual storytelling rather than stated explicitly
- The setting (home environment) is relatable to the target audience of home fitness enthusiasts
- Text overlay is minimal and properly contrasted for readability

Recommendations:
1. Consider adding a subtle brand identifier (logo) in one corner to increase brand recognition even when the image is viewed without accompanying text
2. Test a version with a more diverse model to expand audience identification with the advertisement
```

## Variations
This framework can be adapted for specific types of visual analysis by modifying the PURPOSE parameter:
- Product photography assessment
- UI/UX design feedback
- Brand consistency evaluation
- Technical diagram review
- Educational material visual assessment
