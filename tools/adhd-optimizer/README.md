# ADHD Prompt Optimizer

Transform any prompt into a context-optimized version using ADHD prompting principles. This tool analyzes your input and restructures it for maximum clarity and minimum token usage.

## How to Use

1. Copy your original prompt
2. Run it through the optimization process below
3. Compare results and token savings
4. Use the optimized version for better AI responses

## Optimization Process

When optimizing a prompt, I follow this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Extract Core Information
- **Primary objective**: What's the main ask?
- **Context elements**: What background is essential?
- **Constraints**: What limitations exist?
- **Output requirements**: What form should the result take?
- **Hidden complexity**: What's implied but not stated?

### Step 2: Apply ADHD Principles
1. **Front-load critical info**: Move the main ask to position #1
2. **Structure with markers**: Add emoji/semantic anchors
3. **Compress redundancy**: Remove filler, combine related points
4. **Make implicit explicit**: State all assumptions clearly
5. **Chunk logically**: Group related requirements

### Step 3: Format for Context Efficiency
- Use bullet lists over paragraphs
- Replace phrases with structured notation
- Add progressive disclosure for optional details
- Create scannable sections

## Optimization Templates

### For Vague Prompts
**Input Pattern**: "I need help with X, considering Y and Z..."

**Optimization**:
```markdown
🎯 TASK: [Extracted main objective]
📋 CONTEXT: 
- [Key fact 1]
- [Key fact 2]
🤔 CONSIDERATIONS: [Y, Z as bullets]
✅ SUCCESS: [Inferred success criteria]
```

### For Technical Prompts
**Input Pattern**: "Create a function that does X with requirements Y..."

**Optimization**:
```markdown
🔧 FUNCTION: [name]
📥 INPUT: [type/format]
📤 OUTPUT: [type/format]
📋 REQUIREMENTS:
- [Req 1]
- [Req 2]
⚡ CONSTRAINTS: [performance/limits]
```

### For Learning Prompts
**Input Pattern**: "Explain X, I know Y, want to understand Z..."

**Optimization**:
```markdown
📚 LEARN: [X - specific topic]
🎓 BASELINE: [Y - current knowledge]
🎯 TARGET: [Z - desired understanding]
💡 FORMAT: [examples/theory/both]
⏱️ DEPTH: [quick overview/deep dive]
```

### For Debugging Prompts
**Input Pattern**: "My code isn't working, error is X, tried Y..."

**Optimization**:
```markdown
🐛 ERROR: [Exact error message]
📍 LOCATION: [File/function/line]
🔍 ATTEMPTED: 
- [Fix 1]
- [Fix 2]
💭 HYPOTHESIS: [Current theory]
📋 CONTEXT: [Relevant setup/config]
❓ NEED: [Specific help needed]
```

### For Creative Prompts
**Input Pattern**: "Write something about X in style Y..."

**Optimization**:
```markdown
✍️ CREATE: [Content type]
🎯 TOPIC: [X - subject matter]
🎨 STYLE: [Y - tone/voice]
📏 LENGTH: [word/paragraph count]
🎪 AUDIENCE: [target reader]
⚠️ AVOID: [what not to include]
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. The Compression Algorithm
```
Original: "I'm working on a project where I need to..."
Compressed: "PROJECT: [name] | NEED: [specific requirement]"
Savings: ~70% tokens
```

### 2. The State Machine
```
Original: "Based on what we discussed earlier..."
Optimized: "CONTEXT: [Previous decision/state]"
Benefit: No ambiguity, no search overhead
```

### 3. The Hierarchy Flip
```
Original: [Background]...[Context]...[Actual question]
Optimized: [Question] → [Essential context] → [Optional background]
Benefit: AI focuses on right priority
```

### 4. The Constraint Box
```
Original: Scattered requirements throughout prompt
Optimized: 
⚠️ CONSTRAINTS:
- Budget: $X
- Time: Y days
- Tech: Must use Z
Benefit: Clear boundaries, no missed requirements
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Vague Business Request
**Original** (87 tokens):
```
I'm thinking about starting a new online business and I'm not sure what kind of business model would work best. I have some experience in marketing and I'm interested in AI tools. What would you recommend?
```

**Optimized** (42 tokens):
```markdown
🎯 TASK: Recommend online business model
📋 CONTEXT:
- Background: Marketing
- Interest: AI tools
💡 NEED: Business model options
✅ OUTPUT: Recommendations with rationale
```
**Savings**: 52% fewer tokens

### Example 2: Complex Technical Request
**Original** (134 tokens):
```
I need to build a REST API for a social media application that handles user authentication, post creation, comments, and likes. It should be scalable and use modern best practices. I'm planning to use Node.js and PostgreSQL. Security is really important and I want to make sure the API is well-documented. Can you help me design this?
```

**Optimized** (71 tokens):
```markdown
🎯 BUILD: Social media REST API
🔧 STACK: Node.js + PostgreSQL
📋 FEATURES:
- Auth (users)
- Posts (CRUD)
- Comments
- Likes
⚡ REQUIREMENTS:
- Scalable architecture
- Security-first
- API documentation
✅ NEED: Design + best practices
```
**Savings**: 47% fewer tokens

### Example 3: Learning Request with Context
**Original** (108 tokens):
```
I've been working with React for about a year and I'm comfortable with components and state management. Now I want to learn about performance optimization. Specifically, I'm seeing some lag in my application when rendering large lists. What are the best techniques I should know about?
```

**Optimized** (49 tokens):
```markdown
📚 LEARN: React performance optimization
🎓 LEVEL: 1yr experience, know state management
🐛 ISSUE: Large list rendering lag
🎯 NEED: Optimization techniques
💡 FOCUS: Practical solutions
```
**Savings**: 55% fewer tokens

## Pro Tips

1. **Start minimal**: Add only essential context
2. **Use consistent markers**: Same emoji = same meaning
3. **Test both versions**: Compare outputs
4. **Iterate structure**: Refine based on results
5. **Save templates**: Reuse successful patterns
