# Claude.md Improvement Summary

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Logical Flow Structure**
**Before:** Mixed sections with no clear hierarchy
**After:** Clear progression:
```
Identity → Memory → Development → Commands → Tools → Context
```

### 2. **Removed Duplication**
- Consolidated duplicate userPreferences sections
- Merged redundant memory instructions
- Combined tool access descriptions

### 3. **Extracted Embedded Content**
- Moved "The Vibe Coder" project content to `/project-vibecoder` command
- This was 100+ lines that interrupted the flow
- Now accessible via command when needed

### 4. **Organized Commands**
Grouped by purpose:
- **Development**: /tdd, /typescript, /functional, /refactor
- **Philosophy**: /vibecoder, /patterns  
- **Projects**: /project1, /project2, /project3
- **Utilities**: /search, /frameworks, /memory

### 5. **Cleaner Sections**
Each section now has:
- Clear heading
- Concise content
- Logical connection to next section

## Benefits

1. **Faster Loading**: Removed ~40% of content by eliminating duplication
2. **Better Navigation**: Clear sections make finding information easier
3. **Modular Commands**: Vibe Coder philosophy available when needed, not always loaded
4. **Consistent Style**: All sections follow same formatting pattern
5. **Logical Flow**: Information builds naturally from basics to specifics

## Usage

- More scannable
