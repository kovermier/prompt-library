# Prompt Library Restructuring Report

## Overview

The prompt library has been successfully restructured according to your specifications. This report outlines the changes made and next steps.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Directory Structure Changes**:
   - Deprecated the separate `personas/` directory
   - Integrated personas into relevant task categories (`tasks/coding/personas/`, etc.)
   - Maintained the frameworks and templates directories
   - Added `tasks/etc` for miscellaneous task types

2. **Prompt Processing**:
   - Processed 3 prompts from NeedsProcessing.txt:
     - "Cline: Rapid Full-Stack Dev & UI/UX Expert" → `tasks/coding/rapid-fullstack-dev.md`
     - "PromptPerfector" → `tasks/writing/prompt-perfector.md`
     - "Audio Analysis Reconciliation Expert" → `tasks/analysis/audio/audio-analysis-reconciliation.md`

3. **Metadata Format**:
   - Maintained YAML front matter for metadata
   - Updated the `category` field in all processed files
   - Used Markdown for the prompt content
   - Ensured consistent formatting across files

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md to reflect the new structure
   - Created PERSONAS_DEPRECATION.md to document the migration
   - Updated version number to 3.0 in README.md
   - Updated the "Last updated" date to May 24, 2025

5. **Migration Tools**:
   - Created `migrate_personas.sh` (Bash script)
   - Created `migrate_personas.ps1` (PowerShell script)
   - These scripts will handle any remaining persona files

6. **Knowledge Graph Updates**:
   - Added Prompt Library as a project
   - Connected Kurt Overmier as the manager
   - Added observations about the restructuring

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration Scripts**:
   ```
   # On Windows
   .\migrate_personas.ps1
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   bash migrate_personas.sh
   ```

2. **Remove Original Personas Directory**:
   After verifying all files have been properly migrated, the original `personas/` directory can be removed.

3. **Repository Testing**:
   Verify all links and references work correctly with the new structure.

4. **Future Prompts**:
   - Continue adding new prompts to the appropriate task category
   - If the prompt is persona-based, place it in the relevant `tasks/[category]/personas/` subdirectory

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Automated Tools**:
   Consider developing a simple tool to validate prompt format consistency.

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   Create more detailed guides for each task category.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   Implement a simple search tool that uses the YAML front matter for finding prompts.

4. **Integration Examples**:
   Add examples of how to integrate these prompts into different workflows.

## Conclusion

The prompt library now follows a cleaner, more intuitive structure that eliminates the confusion between task-based and persona-based organization. All prompts are now organized by their primary purpose first, with personas integrated into the relevant task categories.
