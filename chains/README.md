# Prompt Chains

This directory contains prompt chains - sequences of prompts designed to work together to accomplish complex tasks. Each chain connects multiple specialized prompts where the output of one becomes the input for the next.

## What Is a Prompt Chain?

A prompt chain is a workflow that breaks down a complex task into discrete steps, each handled by a specialized prompt. By chaining prompts together, you can:

1. Create more complex and sophisticated outputs
2. Maintain quality control at each stage
3. Allow for human review/intervention between stages
4. Leverage specialized expertise for different aspects of a task
5. Build modular, reusable prompt components

## Structure of a Prompt Chain

Each prompt chain in this directory includes:

- **Chain Overview**: Visual representation of the workflow
- **Stage Descriptions**: Detailed information about each prompt in the chain
- **Parameters**: Required inputs for each stage
- **Expected Outputs**: What each stage produces
- **Chain Usage Instructions**: How to implement the entire workflow
- **Example Workflow**: A concrete example of the chain in action
- **Variations**: Suggested modifications for different use cases

## Available Chains

- **Content Development Chain**: A complete workflow for creating content from ideation to publication
- **Visual Content Chain**: A process for creating visual social media content from concept to finished post

## How to Use Prompt Chains

1. **Understand the Workflow**: Review the entire chain to understand how the stages connect
2. **Prepare Your Inputs**: Gather all the initial parameters needed for the first stage
3. **Execute Sequentially**: Run each prompt in order, using outputs as inputs for the next stage
4. **Review Between Stages**: Check outputs at each stage before proceeding
5. **Iterate as Needed**: You can rerun any stage with adjustments if the output isn't satisfactory

## Creating New Chains

When creating new prompt chains, consider:

1. Breaking complex tasks into logical, discrete steps
2. Ensuring clear input/output relationships between stages
3. Providing comprehensive documentation for each stage
4. Including examples of how the chain works end-to-end
5. Considering where human review or input might be valuable

## Best Practices

- Save outputs from each stage for reference and iteration
- Consider creating variations of chains for different use cases
- Document successful chains and their results
- Refine prompts based on actual usage results
- Consider adding custom stages to address specific needs
