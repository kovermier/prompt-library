# Visual Content Development Chain

## Context
This prompt chain creates a complete workflow for developing visual content, from initial concept to finished social media post. It's designed for content creators, marketers, and social media managers who want to systematically create high-quality visual content with accompanying text elements.

## Chain Overview

```
Concept Generation → Prompt Enhancement → Post Creation
```

This chain connects three specialized prompts:
1. **Concept Generation**: Generate initial visual concepts based on content themes
2. **Prompt Enhancement**: Refine the concept into a detailed, effective image generation prompt
3. **Post Creation**: Develop a complete social media post with the visual and accompanying text

## Stage 1: Concept Generation

### Prompt
```
Create a short idea for the selected image type: {image_type}, that would pair well with the following content theme:

{content_theme}

The idea template should be a simple composition:
A [IMAGE_TYPE] of [SUBJECT] [in relation to] [BACKGROUND]

Guidelines:
1. Keep composition simple and clear
2. Focus on single subject-background relationship
3. Ensure visual hierarchy
4. Consider platform-specific requirements for {platform}
```

### Parameters
- `image_type`: The type of image to be created (photograph, illustration, 3D render, etc.)
- `content_theme`: The theme, message, or topic the image should represent
- `platform`: The social media platform where the image will be used

### Output
A concise image concept that describes the subject, composition, and background.

## Stage 2: Prompt Enhancement

### Prompt
```
Create a prompt to be used for a photographic image generation for the below idea. Use precise, visual descriptions (rather than metaphorical concepts).

Try to keep the prompt short, yet precise.

Prompt Structure:
"A [image type] of [subject], [subject's characteristics], [relation to background] [background]. [Details of background] [Interactions with color and lighting]. Taken on [Details of camera, lens, style and settings]."

The photo composition should be simple.

The idea: {image_concept}
```

### Parameters
- `image_concept`: The image concept from Stage 1

### Output
A detailed, effective image generation prompt that could be used with AI image generators or as a reference for photographers/designers.

## Stage 3: Post Creation

### Prompt
```
You are a social media graphic designer and content creator, whose job it is to create engaging social media posts.

Create a social media post concept for:
Platform: {platform}
Brand Voice: {brand_voice}
Target Audience: {target_audience}
Core Message: {core_message}

The post will use an image with the following description:
{image_prompt}

Provide:
1. A complete caption (including hashtags if appropriate)
2. Suggested text overlay for the image (if any)
3. Call to action
4. Any additional notes about optimal posting time or engagement strategy
```

### Parameters
- `platform`: The social media platform for the post
- `brand_voice`: Description of the brand's tone and personality
- `target_audience`: The intended audience for the post
- `core_message`: The main idea or message to be communicated
- `image_prompt`: The enhanced image prompt from Stage 2

### Output
A complete social media post concept with caption, text elements, call to action, and strategic recommendations.

## Chain Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Determine your content theme and message
2. Identify your target platform, audience, and brand voice
3. Choose the appropriate image type for your needs

### Execution Process
1. Run Stage 1 (Concept Generation) with your initial parameters
2. Review the image concept and make any adjustments
3. Run Stage 2 (Prompt Enhancement) using the approved concept
4. Review the enhanced prompt for clarity and effectiveness
5. Run Stage 3 (Post Creation) using the prompt and additional parameters
6. Make any final adjustments to the post concept

### Tips for Effective Chain Use
- Platform specifications should inform all stages (different platforms have different optimal image sizes and styles)
- The chain can be expanded to include multiple image concepts for A/B testing
- Save prompts from successful posts to build a library of effective visual concepts
- You can iterate on any stage if the output doesn't meet your needs
