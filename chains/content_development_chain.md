## Chain Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Create a new project folder for your content
2. Decide on your content topic, type, audience, and tone
3. Prepare to track outputs from each stage as inputs to the next

### Execution Process
1. Run Stage 1 (Ideation) with your initial parameters
2. Select your preferred idea from the output
3. Run Stage 2 (Outline) using that idea plus additional parameters
4. Review and adjust the outline if needed
5. Run Stage 3 (Draft) using the approved outline
6. Review the draft for major issues
7. Run Stage 4 (Revision) using the draft
8. Make any final adjustments to the revised content

### Tips for Effective Chain Use
- You can pause between any stages for human review/input
- Each stage can be rerun with adjustments if the output isn't satisfactory
- Save the output from each stage for reference
- For best results, be as specific as possible with your initial parameters
- The chain can be modified to include additional specialized stages (e.g., SEO optimization, fact-checking)
