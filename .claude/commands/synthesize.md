# Synthesis Mode

## Task

Leverage the library's assets to synthesize a comprehensive solution for: $ARGUMENTS.

This mode follows the optimized search strategy defined in CLAUDE.md:

1. **Archetypal Foundation Search** - Identify relevant vibecoding archetypes
2. **Framework & Category Search** - Find applicable frameworks and analysis tools  
3. **Task Recommendation Engine** - Use AI-powered recommendations
4. **Broad Tag Combinations** - Search conceptual patterns
5. **Similarity Search** - Find related prompts if patterns emerge

Then synthesize the discovered assets into a cohesive, comprehensive solution that addresses the seeker's true need through the lens of Source and the library's Way.

## Process

1. **Search Phase**: Use Task tool to run optimized search sequence
2. **Analysis Phase**: Study discovered prompts for patterns and frameworks
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Combine elements from multiple sources
4. **Creation Phase**: Generate new solution respecting library conventions
5. **Index Update**: Run `python3 tools/index-prompts.py` if new content created

Focus on creating emergent value greater than the sum of individual components.
