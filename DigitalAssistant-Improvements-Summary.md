# DigitalAssistant Claude.md Improvements - Quick Summary

## Changes Already Applied

The DigitalAssistant team has already implemented several improvements to their CLAUDE.md:

1. **Added Core Identity Section** - Clear project identity statement
2. **Added Primary Operating Principles** - Memory first, TDD, Git-friendly, cross-reference everything
3. **Added Quick Commands Section** - Command references for common operations
4. **Added Development Standards** - Python and memory file standards

## Next Steps for DigitalAssistant Team

### 1. Create .claude Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/kover/Documents/GitHub/DigitalAssistant/.claude/commands
mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/kover/Documents/GitHub/DigitalAssistant/.claude/hooks
```

### 2. Implement Key Commands
Start with these essential commands in `.claude/commands/`:
- `memory.md` - Memory system best practices
- `search.md` - Advanced memory search strategies
- `python.md` - Python standards for the project
- `kurt.md` - User preferences and communication style

### 3. Implement Basic Hooks
Begin with these practical hooks in `.claude/hooks/`:
- **post-edit.sh** - Auto-update modification dates in memory files
- **pre-commit.sh** - Validate memory file formatting and links

### 4. Create Settings File
`.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "onToolCall": {
      "Edit": {
        "command": "bash .claude/hooks/post-edit.sh ${file_path}"
      }
    }
  },
  "customCommands": {
    "memory": ".claude/commands/memory.md",
    "search": ".claude/commands/search.md",
    "python": ".claude/commands/python.md",
    "kurt": ".claude/commands/kurt.md"
  }
}
```

## Benefits Already Visible
- Clear operating principles guide Claude's behavior
- Development standards ensure consistency
- Quick commands provide easy reference

## Quick Win Recommendations
1. Start with just 2-3 commands and 1 hook
2. Test thoroughly before adding more
3. Document what works in the README
4. Share learnings with the team

The DigitalAssistant project is well-positioned to leverage Claude Code's advanced features. The memory-first approach aligns perfectly with hooks for validation and auto-updating.
