# Creativity Frameworks

This directory contains frameworks specifically designed to enhance creative thinking, idea generation, and innovation. These frameworks provide structured methodologies for exploring possibilities, making novel connections, and developing original solutions.

## What Are Creativity Frameworks?

Creativity frameworks are structured approaches that guide language models through systematic processes for generating innovative ideas and solutions. Unlike problem-solving frameworks that focus on analysis, creativity frameworks are optimized for:

1. **Divergent Thinking**: Generating multiple possibilities and alternatives
2. **Novel Connections**: Finding unexpected relationships between concepts
3. **Constraint Navigation**: Working creatively within defined boundaries
4. **Perspective Shifting**: Viewing challenges from unconventional angles
5. **Idea Refinement**: Developing and improving creative concepts

## Available Frameworks

*Note: This is a placeholder for future creativity frameworks. As new frameworks are added, they will be documented here.*

## When to Use Creativity Frameworks

These frameworks are particularly valuable when:

1. Needing fresh approaches to persistent challenges
2. Exploring new possibilities beyond conventional solutions
3. Developing innovative products, services, or content
4. Breaking through creative blocks or limitations
5. Combining ideas from different domains in novel ways

## Framework Selection Guide

When selecting a creativity framework, consider:

1. **Goal Type**: Generation of many ideas vs. development of a single breakthrough
2. **Constraint Level**: Working within tight constraints vs. unlimited exploration
3. **Domain Specificity**: Framework optimized for particular creative domains
4. **Process Length**: Quick ideation vs. comprehensive creative process
5. **Individual vs. Collaborative**: Designed for solo or group creativity

## Usage Tips

When implementing creativity frameworks:

1. **Defer judgment**: Generate ideas freely before evaluating them
2. **Embrace constraints**: Use limitations as creative fuel rather than obstacles
3. **Follow the process**: Trust the framework even when it seems unconventional
4. **Capture everything**: Record all ideas, even those that seem impractical
5. **Allow incubation**: Give ideas time to develop and connections to form

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new creativity frameworks to this directory:

1. Follow the standardized format with YAML frontmatter
2. Clearly explain the framework's creative methodology
3. Provide examples of creative outputs generated using the framework
4. Document limitations and ideal use cases
5. Include implementation guidelines with specific prompts or triggers
