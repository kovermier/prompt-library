# Decision-Making Frameworks

This directory contains frameworks specifically designed to enhance decision-making processes. These frameworks provide structured methodologies for analyzing complex decision scenarios, evaluating options, and selecting optimal solutions across various domains.

## What Are Decision-Making Frameworks?

Decision-making frameworks are structured approaches that guide language models through systematic processes for evaluating options and making well-reasoned choices. Unlike general reasoning frameworks, these are specifically optimized for:

1. **Option Analysis**: Methodically evaluating multiple possibilities
2. **Criteria Weighting**: Systematically prioritizing decision factors
3. **Impact Assessment**: Predicting outcomes of different choices
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Adapting decisions to various contexts
5. **Resource Optimization**: Balancing constraints and outcomes

## Available Frameworks

### Enhanced Global Analysis Framework (EGAF)
A comprehensive framework for tackling complex decisions across diverse domains with a focus on cultural adaptability, resource optimization, and universal applicability.

Key strengths:
- Cross-cultural decision adaptation
- Resource constraint handling
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Scalable solution development

## When to Use Decision-Making Frameworks

These frameworks are particularly valuable when:

1. Facing complex decisions with multiple variables
2. Working across different cultural contexts
3. Balancing competing priorities or constraints
4. Needing to document and justify decision rationales
5. Developing scalable decision methodologies

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Key Strength | Best For | Complexity |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| EGAF | Cultural adaptability | Global, multi-domain decisions | Medium-High |

## Usage Tips

When implementing these decision-making frameworks:

1. **Define the problem carefully**: The quality of the framework output depends on clear problem definition
2. **Be explicit about constraints**: Clearly articulate limitations and boundaries
3. **Consider cultural context**: Recognize how cultural factors influence decisions
4. **Document the process**: Record the reasoning at each stage
5. **Iterate as needed**: Decision-making often requires multiple refinement cycles

## When to Use Other Framework Types

Consider alternatives when:

- **Creative Solutions** are primary (use Creativity frameworks)
- **Technical Problem-Solving** is the focus (use Problem-solving frameworks)
- **Simple Decisions** don't warrant full framework application

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new decision-making frameworks to this directory:

1. Follow the standardized format with YAML frontmatter
2. Clearly explain the framework's decision methodology
3. Provide concrete examples of application
4. Document limitations and ideal use cases
5. Include implementation guidelines
