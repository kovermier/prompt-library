# Frameworks Summary

This directory contains various frameworks for problem-solving and reasoning, each with a unique approach:

## 1. Reasoning v2 Framework

This framework emphasizes a rigorous and detailed reasoning process for every query, focusing on input comprehension, contextual analysis, knowledge retrieval, solution generation, critical review, response formulation, and ethical compliance.  It aims to provide the most accurate, helpful, and efficient response possible.

## 2. ECARLM (Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models)

ECARLM combines cellular automata principles with language model processing. It uses multi-scale state evolution and pattern recognition for complex problem-solving.  It operates through Macro (system), Meso (component), and Micro (implementation) scales, requiring strict adherence to state management, rule application, and validation procedures.

## 3. Enhanced Global Analysis Framework (EGAF)

EGAF tackles complex problems across diverse domains with a focus on cultural adaptability, resource optimization, and universal applicability.  It features a Meta-Analysis Layer, Implementation Layer, and Validation Framework, emphasizing a phased approach from initial analysis to solution refinement.

## 4. Enhanced Logic-Based Synergistic Framework (ELSF)

ELSF uses formal logic, pattern recognition, and an integration layer for problem-solving.  It involves problem decomposition, logical analysis, pattern analysis, and a synthesis process.  The framework includes a Logic Engine, Pattern Analyzer, Integration Manager, and Validation System.

## 5. Fractal Framework

This framework provides a multi-scale approach to prompt engineering, addressing LLM constraints through structured decomposition, context setting, and cross-scale integration.  It operates across Macro, Meso, and Micro scales, offering a structured template for prompt construction and emphasizing quality assurance.

## 6. METRICS+ Framework

METRICS+ is a layered approach to problem-solving, requiring responses to follow a specific analysis process through Direct, Meta, Pattern Recognition, Knowledge Integration, and Emotional Processing layers.  It emphasizes connecting patterns from other domains and ending with a meta-level insight.
