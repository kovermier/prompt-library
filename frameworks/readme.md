# Frameworks Summary

This directory contains various frameworks for problem-solving and reasoning, each with a unique approach:

## 1. Reasoning v2 Framework

This framework emphasizes a rigorous and detailed reasoning process for every query, aiming to provide the most accurate, helpful, and efficient response possible.  It involves the following key steps:

* **Input Comprehension:** Analyze the query using language parsing, semantic analysis, intent recognition, and emotion/tone detection.
* **Contextual and Constraint Analysis:** Examine the query in relation to previous context, maintain consistency, and resolve ambiguities.
* **Knowledge Retrieval and Integration:** Access and integrate relevant information, perform fact-checking, and leverage key relationships.
* **Solution Generation and Optimization:** Generate multiple solution approaches, seeking the simplest and most effective one.
* **Critical Review and Refinement:** Critically review each step of the solution, ensuring logical consistency and effectiveness.
* **Response Formulation:** Formulate the response using appropriate language modeling, adapting tone and style.
* **Ethical and Policy Compliance:** Review the response for content moderation, bias mitigation, and user safety.
* **Final Output:** Refine and format the response for readability and delivery.


## 2. ECARLM (Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models)

ECARLM combines cellular automata principles with language model processing. It uses multi-scale state evolution and pattern recognition for complex problem-solving.  It operates through Macro (system), Meso (component), and Micro (implementation) scales, requiring strict adherence to state management, rule application, and validation procedures.

## 3. Enhanced Global Analysis Framework (EGAF)

EGAF tackles complex problems across diverse domains with a focus on cultural adaptability, resource optimization, and universal applicability.  It features a Meta-Analysis Layer, Implementation Layer, and Validation Framework, emphasizing a phased approach from initial analysis to solution refinement.

## 4. Enhanced Logic-Based Synergistic Framework (ELSF)

ELSF uses formal logic, pattern recognition, and an integration layer for problem-solving.  It involves problem decomposition, logical analysis, pattern analysis, and a synthesis process.  The framework includes a Logic Engine, Pattern Analyzer, Integration Manager, and Validation System.

## 5. Fractal Framework

This framework provides a multi-scale approach to prompt engineering, addressing LLM constraints through structured decomposition, context setting, and cross-scale integration.  It operates across Macro, Meso, and Micro scales, offering a structured template for prompt construction and emphasizing quality assurance.

## 6. METRICS+ Framework

METRICS+ is a layered approach to problem-solving, requiring responses to follow a specific analysis process through Direct, Meta, Pattern Recognition, Knowledge Integration, and Emotional Processing layers.  It emphasizes connecting patterns from other domains and ending with a meta-level insight.
