# Problem-Solving Frameworks

This directory contains frameworks specifically designed to enhance systematic problem-solving capabilities. These frameworks provide structured methodologies for breaking down complex problems, analyzing them from multiple perspectives, and developing comprehensive solutions.

## What Are Problem-Solving Frameworks?

Problem-solving frameworks are structured approaches that guide language models through systematic processes for analyzing and resolving complex challenges. Unlike general reasoning frameworks or decision-making frameworks, these are specifically optimized for:

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable components
2. **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Examining issues from different viewpoints and scales
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring patterns and principles
4. **Integration**: Synthesizing insights across different levels of analysis
5. **Solution Development**: Generating comprehensive, coherent solutions

## Available Frameworks

### ECARLM (Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models)
A framework that combines cellular automata principles with language model processing, using multi-scale state evolution and pattern recognition for complex problem-solving.

Key strengths:
- Quantum-inspired state representations
- Multi-scale processing
- Cellular evolution patterns
- Formal validation mechanisms

### Fractal Framework
A multi-scale approach to problem-solving that addresses LLM constraints through structured decomposition, explicit context setting, and cross-scale integration.

Key strengths:
- Structured decomposition across scales
- Explicit context setting
- Cross-scale pattern recognition
- Systematic synthesis approach

## When to Use Problem-Solving Frameworks

These frameworks are particularly valuable when:

1. Facing complex, multi-faceted problems
2. Requiring analysis at different levels of abstraction
3. Working with systems that have interacting components
4. Needing structured approaches to ensure comprehensive analysis
5. Dealing with emergent properties that appear across different scales

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Key Strength | Best For | Complexity |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| ECARLM | State evolution modeling | Complex systems with evolving states | High |
| Fractal | Multi-scale decomposition | Problems benefiting from analysis at different levels | Medium-High |

## Usage Tips

When implementing these problem-solving frameworks:

1. **Invest time in problem definition**: Clearly articulate the problem before applying the framework
2. **Follow the structure**: The power of these frameworks comes from their systematic approach
3. **Complete all steps**: Don't skip sections even if they seem less relevant initially
4. **Balance depth and breadth**: Adjust the level of detail based on the problem complexity
5. **Look for emergent insights**: The most valuable insights often come from integrating across components

## When to Use Other Framework Types

Consider alternatives when:

- **Decision-making between options** is the focus (use Decision-making frameworks)
- **Generating creative solutions** is primary (use Creativity frameworks)
- **Simple, straightforward problems** don't warrant full framework application

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new problem-solving frameworks to this directory:

1. Follow the standardized format with YAML frontmatter
2. Clearly explain the framework's problem-solving methodology
3. Provide a complete example of application
4. Document limitations and ideal use cases
5. Include implementation guidelines with specific prompts or triggers
