# Fractal Framework

This framework offers a multi-scale approach to prompt engineering, addressing the complexities of reasoning within LLM constraints. It emphasizes structured decomposition, explicit context setting, and cross-scale integration for enhanced understanding and output quality.

## Key Features:

* **Multi-Scale Analysis:**  Operates across Macro (overall structure), Meso (component level), and Micro (specific patterns) scales, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
* **Structured Decomposition:**  Breaks down complex prompts into manageable components, facilitating systematic reasoning.
* **Explicit Context Setting:**  Emphasizes clear definition of scale, domain, constraints, and assumptions for improved reasoning quality.
* **Cross-Scale Integration:**  Connects insights across scales to capture emergent properties and develop a unified understanding.

## How it Works:

The framework provides a structured template for prompt construction, guiding users through context setting, analysis, synthesis, and integration at each scale.  Specific prompt patterns and triggers ensure consistent application and maintain structure.

## Benefits:

* **Enhanced Reasoning Quality:**  Reduces reasoning gaps and improves coherence through structured analysis and synthesis.
* **Improved Completeness:**  Ensures thorough exploration of the problem space by addressing different scales and perspectives.
* **Adaptability:**  Applicable to various domains and scales with problem complexity.
* **Systematic Approach:**  Provides a clear framework for prompt engineering, promoting consistency and quality.

## Getting Started:

See `fractal_framework.md` for detailed explanation and usage guidelines.  The framework includes example prompt templates and component-specific guidance.  Start at the Macro scale and decompose systematically, maintaining explicit transitions and ensuring complete synthesis at each level.  Finally, integrate insights across scales to develop a unified understanding.
