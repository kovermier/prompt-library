# 1. Introduction

Cellular automata (CA) have long fascinated researchers in computer science and complex systems due to their ability to generate complex behavior from simple, local rules. Among these, Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA), introduced and extensively studied by Stephen Wolfram, represent the simplest class of one-dimensional cellular automata. Despite their minimal structure, ECA can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from simple periodic patterns to chaotic and even computationally universal dynamics.

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen remarkable advances in recent years, primarily driven by large-scale neural language models. However, these models often face challenges in interpretability, efficiency, and handling long-range dependencies in text. Inspired by the elegance and emergent complexity of ECA, we propose the Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models (ECARLM) framework as a novel approach to address these challenges.

ECARLM adapts the core principles of ECA to the domain of language processing:

1. Discrete state representation of language elements
2. Local interaction rules for context processing
3. Iterative evolution of language representations
4. Emergent complex behavior from simple rules

By representing language elements as cells with discrete states and defining local interaction rules, ECARLM aims to capture the contextual relationships and dependencies in text through an iterative evolution process. This approach offers several potential advantages:

- Interpretability: The rules and state transitions in ECARLM can be easily understood and analyzed, providing insights into the reasoning process.
- Efficiency: The local nature of rule applications allows for parallel processing and potentially reduced computational complexity.
- Contextual sensitivity: Iterative evolution of states enables the capture of long-range dependencies and complex contextual relationships.
- Adaptability: The framework can be easily modified for different languages, domains, or specific NLP tasks by adjusting the rule set and state representations.

In this paper, we present the ECARLM framework in detail, describing its structure, state representation scheme, reasoning rules, and evolution mechanism. We explore potential applications of ECARLM to various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text summarization, and machine translation. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the framework, as well as exciting directions for future research.

The ECARLM framework represents a novel intersection of ideas from discrete dynamical systems and natural language processing. By leveraging the simplicity and emergent complexity of cellular automata, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on language modeling and open new avenues for research in interpretable and efficient NLP systems.

# 2. Background

## 2.1 Elementary Cellular Automata

Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA), introduced and extensively studied by Stephen Wolfram, represent the simplest class of one-dimensional cellular automata. An ECA consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which can be in one of two states (typically represented as 0 or 1). The system evolves in discrete time steps, with each cell's state updated based on its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors.

Formally, an ECA is defined by a local update rule ùëì: {0,1}¬≥ ‚Üí {0,1}, which determines the next state of a cell based on its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. With three input bits, there are 2¬≥ = 8 possible input configurations, leading to 2‚Å∏ = 256 possible rules for ECA.

Wolfram classified the behavior of ECA into four classes:

1. Class 1: Evolution leads to a homogeneous state
2. Class 2: Evolution leads to simple separated periodic structures
3. Class 3: Evolution leads to chaotic aperiodic patterns
4. Class 4: Evolution leads to complex patterns with localized structures that interact in complicated ways

Despite their simplicity, ECA can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from simple periodic patterns to chaotic and even computationally universal dynamics. This emergent complexity from simple rules has made ECA a subject of fascination in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science.

## 2.2 Language Models and Current Challenges

Language models are a cornerstone of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), used in a wide range of applications from machine translation to text generation. Traditional statistical language models have been largely superseded by neural network-based models, particularly transformer-based architectures like BERT, GPT, and their variants.

While these models have achieved remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, they still face several challenges:

1. Interpretability: The decision-making process in neural language models is often opaque, making it difficult to understand or explain their predictions.

2. Computational Efficiency: Large-scale language models require significant computational resources for training and inference.

3. Long-range Dependencies: Despite improvements, capturing and utilizing long-range dependencies in text remains a challenge for many models.

4. Contextual Understanding: Truly understanding context and nuance in language, beyond statistical patterns, is an ongoing challenge.

## 2.3 Intersection of ECA and Language Models

In recent years, researchers have begun exploring the application of ECA principles to language modeling, leading to the development of approaches like Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models (ECARLM). This intersection aims to leverage the simplicity and emergent complexity of ECA to address some of the challenges faced by traditional language models.

ECARLM represents a novel approach that adapts the core principles of ECA to the domain of language processing:

1. Discrete State Representation: Language elements are represented as cells with discrete states, analogous to the binary states in ECA.
2. Local Interaction Rules: Context processing is achieved through local rules that determine how the state of a cell evolves based on its neighbors.
3. Iterative Evolution: The language representation evolves over multiple time steps, allowing for the capture of complex relationships and long-range dependencies.
4. Emergent Complexity: Complex language understanding emerges from the repeated application of simple rules.

While ECARLM has shown promising results in various NLP tasks, it still faces several challenges:

1. Variable-Length Inputs: Traditional ECARLM is designed for fixed-length inputs, which can struggle with variable-length inputs like text data.
2. Discrete States: ECA's discrete state representation may not capture the nuances of human language, leading to potential loss of information.
3. Optimal Evolution Steps: The number of evolution steps required to achieve good performance is not well established and may need to be tuned for each specific task.
4. Rule Design Complexity: Creating comprehensive rule sets for ECARLM can be complex and may require significant human expertise.

Despite these challenges, the intersection of ECA and language models opens up exciting new research directions:

1. Hybrid Models: Combining ECARLM with neural networks could leverage the strengths of both approaches to improve performance.
2. Dynamic Topologies: Adapting cell structures to input complexity could help address the fixed topology limitation.
3. Unsupervised Rule Learning: Automatically deriving reasoning rules from data could simplify the rule design process and improve generalization.
4. Multi-Dimensional ECARLM: Extending ECARLM to 2D or 3D for more complex language representations could open up new possibilities for NLP applications.

The potential applications of ECARLM are diverse and promising:

1. Sentiment Analysis: ECARLM has shown promise in sentiment analysis tasks, where it can capture subtle patterns in text data.
2. Text Generation: ECARLM could be used to generate coherent and context-dependent text, potentially replacing or augmenting existing models.
3. Language Modeling: By incorporating ECA principles, ECARLM may improve language modeling performance by capturing more complex relationships between words.

As research in this area continues, ECARLM and related approaches have the potential to address some of the key challenges in current language models while offering new insights into the nature of language processing and representation.

# 3. ECARLM Framework

The Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models (ECARLM) framework adapts the principles of Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) to the domain of natural language processing. This section describes each component of the framework in detail, providing examples to illustrate key concepts.

## 3.1 Core Principles

The ECARLM framework is built on four core principles derived from ECA:

1. Discrete state representation of language elements
2. Local interaction rules for context processing
3. Iterative evolution of language representations
4. Emergent complex behavior from simple rules

These principles allow ECARLM to capture complex language phenomena while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.

## 3.2 Framework Structure

The ECARLM framework consists of five main components:

1. Input Layer: Tokenized text or embeddings
2. State Cells: Representation of language elements
3. Rule Set: Context-processing rules
4. Evolution Mechanism: Iterative application of rules
5. Output Layer: Processed language representation

### 3.2.1 Input Layer

The input layer takes tokenized text or pre-computed embeddings as input. For example, given the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", the input layer might represent it as:

```
[The] [cat] [sat] [on] [the] [mat]
```

Each token is then mapped to an initial state in the State Cells layer.

### 3.2.2 State Cells

State Cells represent language elements with a richer state space compared to binary ECA. Each cell's state encodes multiple linguistic features, such as:

- Part of speech (POS)
- Semantic role
- Contextual meaning
- Sentiment
- Grammatical function

For example, the initial state of the word "cat" might be represented as:

```
{
  "token": "cat",
  "POS": "NOUN",
  "semantic_role": "SUBJECT",
  "context_vector": [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...],
  "sentiment": "NEUTRAL",
  "grammatical_function": "SUBJECT"
}
```

### 3.2.3 Rule Set

The Rule Set defines how cell states evolve based on their current state and the states of neighboring cells. Rules in ECARLM are more complex than in traditional ECA, capturing various linguistic phenomena. Examples of rules include:

1. Subject-Verb Agreement:
   ```
   IF cell[i].POS == "NOUN" AND cell[i+1].POS == "VERB":
     THEN check_agreement(cell[i], cell[i+1])
   ```

2. Sentiment Propagation:
   ```
   IF cell[i].POS == "ADJ" AND cell[i].sentiment != "NEUTRAL":
     THEN propagate_sentiment(cell[i], cell[i+1])
   ```

3. Named Entity Recognition:
   ```
   IF cell[i].POS == "PROPER_NOUN" AND cell[i-1].token in ["Mr.", "Ms.", "Dr."]:
     THEN mark_as_person(cell[i])
   ```

### 3.2.4 Evolution Mechanism

The Evolution Mechanism applies the rules iteratively to the State Cells. This process allows for the propagation of information and the emergence of higher-level language structures. The evolution occurs in discrete time steps, with all cells updated simultaneously in each step.

For example, consider the sentence "The angry dog barked loudly". The evolution might proceed as follows:

Step 0 (Initial):
```
[The] [angry] [dog] [barked] [loudly]
 DET   ADJ    NOUN  VERB     ADV
```

Step 1:
```
[The] [angry] [dog] [barked] [loudly]
 DET   ADJ    NOUN  VERB     ADV
       NEG           NEG
```
(Sentiment propagation from "angry" to "dog" and "barked")

Step 2:
```
[The] [angry] [dog] [barked] [loudly]
 DET   ADJ    NOUN  VERB     ADV
       NEG    SUBJ  NEG      INTENSIFIER
```
(Subject identification and adverb role assignment)

### 3.2.5 Output Layer

The Output Layer represents the final state of the cells after the evolution process. This processed representation can be used for various NLP tasks. For instance, in a sentiment analysis task, the Output Layer might aggregate the sentiment information from all cells to produce an overall sentiment score for the input text.

## 3.3 State Representation

ECARLM uses a rich state representation to capture various aspects of language. The state of each cell is a tuple or struct containing multiple features. For example:

```python
class CellState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token = ""
        self.pos = ""
        self.semantic_role = ""
        self.context_vector = []
        self.sentiment = "NEUTRAL"
        self.grammatical_function = ""
        self.named_entity_type = None
```

This rich state representation allows ECARLM to capture and process complex linguistic phenomena.

## 3.4 Reasoning Rules

ECARLM's reasoning rules are inspired by ECA but are more complex to handle the intricacies of language. Rules can be categorized into different types:

1. Syntactic Rules: Handle grammatical structures and relationships.
2. Semantic Rules: Process meaning and context.
3. Pragmatic Rules: Deal with language use in context.

Example of a more complex rule for handling subject-verb agreement:

```python
def subject_verb_agreement_rule(cells, i):
    if cells[i].pos == "NOUN" and cells[i+1].pos == "VERB":
        if cells[i].grammatical_function == "SUBJECT":
            if cells[i].number != cells[i+1].number:
                cells[i+1].grammatical_error = "AGREEMENT_ERROR"
        else:
            cells[i].grammatical_function = "SUBJECT"
```

## 3.5 Evolution Mechanism

The evolution mechanism in ECARLM operates over multiple time steps. In each step:

1. All cells are evaluated simultaneously based on their current states and the states of their neighbors.
2. Rules are applied to update cell states.
3. The process repeats for a fixed number of steps or until a convergence criterion is met.

The number of evolution steps can be a hyperparameter tuned for specific tasks. For example:

```python
def evolve(cells, rules, steps):
    for _ in range(steps):
        new_states = [apply_rules(cells, i, rules) for i in range(len(cells))]
        cells = new_states
    return cells
```

This iterative process allows for the propagation of information across the input, enabling the capture of long-range dependencies and complex linguistic phenomena.

# 4. Applications to NLP Tasks

The ECARLM framework can be applied to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this section, we explore how ECARLM can be adapted for four key NLP applications: Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Text Summarization, and Machine Translation. For each application, we provide a detailed example of how ECARLM can be implemented and its potential advantages over traditional approaches.

## 4.1 Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. ECARLM can be particularly effective for this task due to its ability to capture context and propagate sentiment information across a sentence.

### ECARLM Implementation for Sentiment Analysis:

1. **State Representation**: 
   Each cell's state includes a sentiment score ranging from -1 (highly negative) to 1 (highly positive).

2. **Initial State**:
   Sentiment-bearing words (adjectives, adverbs, some verbs and nouns) are initialized with a base sentiment score from a pre-defined lexicon.

3. **Rules**:
   - Sentiment Propagation: Sentiment scores propagate to neighboring words, with diminishing effect over distance.
   - Negation Handling: Negation words invert the sentiment of the following words.
   - Intensifier Detection: Words like "very" or "extremely" amplify the sentiment of the following word.

4. **Evolution**:
   The system evolves for several steps, allowing sentiment to propagate and interact across the sentence.

5. **Output**:
   The final sentiment is determined by aggregating the sentiment scores of all cells.

### Example:

Input: "The movie was not very good, but the acting was fantastic."

Initial State:
```
[The] [movie] [was] [not] [very] [good] [,] [but] [the] [acting] [was] [fantastic]
 0     0       0     0     0      0.6   0    0     0     0        0     0.8
```

After Evolution:
```
[The] [movie] [was] [not] [very] [good] [,] [but] [the] [acting] [was] [fantastic]
-0.1   -0.2    -0.2  -0.3  -0.4   -0.5   0   0.2   0.3    0.5     0.6    0.8
```

Final Output: Slightly Positive (aggregate score: 0.1)

### Advantages of ECARLM for Sentiment Analysis:
1. Captures context and long-range dependencies
2. Handles negations and intensifiers naturally
3. Provides interpretable intermediate states

## 4.2 Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition involves identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text. ECARLM's ability to consider context and propagate information makes it well-suited for this task.

### ECARLM Implementation for NER:

1. **State Representation**: 
   Each cell's state includes a named entity tag (e.g., PERSON, ORG, LOC, O for non-entities) and a confidence score.

2. **Initial State**:
   Cells are initialized based on a dictionary of known entities and common patterns (e.g., capitalized words).

3. **Rules**:
   - Entity Propagation: Entity tags propagate to neighboring words if they form a known multi-word entity.
   - Context Consideration: Surrounding words influence the entity classification (e.g., "Mr." before a capitalized word increases the likelihood of it being a PERSON).
   - Confidence Adjustment: The confidence score is adjusted based on surrounding context and known patterns.

4. **Evolution**:
   The system evolves, allowing entity information to propagate and refine based on context.

5. **Output**:
   The final named entity tags for each word in the input.

### Example:

Input: "Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California."

Initial State:
```
[Steve] [Jobs] [co-founded] [Apple] [Inc.] [in] [Cupertino] [,] [California]
 PERSON  PERSON    O          ORG     ORG    O    LOC        O    LOC
  0.6     0.6      0          0.7     0.8    0    0.5        0    0.8
```

After Evolution:
```
[Steve] [Jobs] [co-founded] [Apple] [Inc.] [in] [Cupertino] [,] [California]
 PERSON  PERSON    O          ORG     ORG    O    LOC        O    LOC
  0.9     0.9      0          0.9     0.9    0    0.8        0    0.9
```

### Advantages of ECARLM for NER:
1. Considers context for improved accuracy
2. Handles multi-word entities effectively
3. Provides confidence scores for each classification

## 4.3 Text Summarization

Text summarization involves creating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text. ECARLM can be adapted for extractive summarization, where key sentences are selected from the original text.

### ECARLM Implementation for Text Summarization:

1. **State Representation**: 
   Each cell represents a sentence and includes features such as sentence length, position in the document, presence of key words, and a relevance score.

2. **Initial State**:
   Sentences are initialized with basic features and a preliminary relevance score based on heuristics (e.g., presence of title words, sentence position).

3. **Rules**:
   - Relevance Propagation: Relevance scores influence neighboring sentences.
   - Redundancy Reduction: Sentences with similar content have their relevance scores reduced.
   - Topic Modeling: Sentences that cover main topics of the document have their relevance increased.

4. **Evolution**:
   The system evolves, allowing relevance information to propagate and refine based on the document's overall structure and content.

5. **Output**:
   Sentences with the highest final relevance scores are selected for the summary.

### Example:

Input: A multi-paragraph article about climate change.

Initial State (showing first few sentences):
```
[Sentence 1: "Climate change is a pressing global issue."] [Sentence 2: "It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions."] ...
 Relevance: 0.7                                            Relevance: 0.5
```

After Evolution:
```
[Sentence 1: "Climate change is a pressing global issue."] [Sentence 2: "It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions."] ...
 Relevance: 0.9                                            Relevance: 0.7
```

### Advantages of ECARLM for Text Summarization:
1. Considers document structure and inter-sentence relationships
2. Can handle long documents by propagating relevance information
3. Provides interpretable relevance scores for each sentence

## 4.4 Machine Translation

While full machine translation is a complex task often handled by neural networks, ECARLM can be used for certain aspects of the translation process, such as word sense disambiguation or handling idiomatic expressions.

### ECARLM Implementation for Word Sense Disambiguation in Translation:

1. **State Representation**: 
   Each cell represents a word and includes possible translations, part of speech, and context vectors.

2. **Initial State**:
   Words are initialized with all possible translations from a bilingual dictionary.

3. **Rules**:
   - Context Matching: Translations that better match the context of surrounding words are given higher scores.
   - Grammatical Consistency: Translations that maintain grammatical consistency with surrounding words are preferred.
   - Idiomatic Expression Detection: Sequences of words that match known idiomatic expressions are treated as a unit.

4. **Evolution**:
   The system evolves, refining translation choices based on context and grammatical constraints.

5. **Output**:
   The most appropriate translation for each word or phrase.

### Example:

Input (English): "The bank of the river was steep."

Initial State:
```
[The] [bank]           [of]  [the] [river] [was] [steep]
      1. financial inst.     
      2. river bank
      3. rely on
```

After Evolution:
```
[The] [bank]           [of]  [the] [river] [was] [steep]
      river bank (0.9)     
```

### Advantages of ECARLM for Machine Translation:
1. Handles context-dependent word sense disambiguation
2. Can incorporate grammatical rules and idiomatic expressions
3. Provides interpretable intermediate states in the translation process

These examples demonstrate how ECARLM can be adapted to various NLP tasks, leveraging its unique properties of context propagation, rule-based evolution, and interpretable states. While ECARLM may not outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in all scenarios, it offers advantages in interpretability, efficiency, and the ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge through custom rules.

# 5. Advantages and Limitations of ECARLM

The Elementary Cellular Automata Reasoning for Language Models (ECARLM) framework offers a novel approach to natural language processing, inspired by the simplicity and emergent complexity of Elementary Cellular Automata. While this approach presents several unique advantages, it also faces certain limitations. This section provides an in-depth analysis of both aspects.

## 5.1 Advantages

### 5.1.1 Interpretability

One of the most significant advantages of ECARLM is its high degree of interpretability. Unlike black-box neural models, ECARLM's decision-making process can be easily traced and understood.

- **Rule Transparency**: The rules in ECARLM are explicitly defined and can be inspected directly. This allows researchers and practitioners to understand exactly how the model is processing language.

- **State Visibility**: The state of each cell at every step of the evolution process can be observed, providing insight into how information propagates through the system.

- **Debuggability**: When errors occur, it's possible to trace back through the evolution steps to identify which rules or initial states led to the incorrect output.

Example: In sentiment analysis, we can trace how the sentiment of individual words propagates and combines to form the overall sentiment of a sentence.

### 5.1.2 Efficiency

ECARLM has the potential to be computationally efficient, especially for certain types of tasks.

- **Parallelizability**: The local nature of rule applications in ECARLM means that many operations can be performed in parallel, potentially leading to significant speed-ups on appropriate hardware.

- **Scalability**: The computational complexity of ECARLM typically scales linearly with the input size and number of evolution steps, making it potentially more scalable than some neural approaches for certain tasks.

- **Low Memory Footprint**: The discrete state representation can be more memory-efficient than continuous representations used in many neural models.

### 5.1.3 Contextual Sensitivity

ECARLM's iterative evolution process allows it to capture complex contextual relationships in text.

- **Long-range Dependencies**: Through multiple evolution steps, information can propagate across long distances in the input, allowing ECARLM to capture long-range dependencies.

- **Emergent Behavior**: Complex language phenomena can emerge from the interaction of simple local rules, potentially capturing subtle linguistic patterns.

Example: In named entity recognition, the classification of an ambiguous proper noun can be influenced by context several words away through the propagation of information over multiple evolution steps.

### 5.1.4 Adaptability

The ECARLM framework is highly adaptable to different tasks and domains.

- **Rule Customization**: The rule set can be easily modified or expanded to incorporate domain-specific knowledge or to adapt to new tasks.

- **Hybrid Potential**: ECARLM can potentially be combined with other techniques, such as neural networks, to create powerful hybrid models.

- **Multilingual Capability**: By defining appropriate rules, ECARLM can be adapted to work with different languages without requiring large amounts of training data.

## 5.2 Limitations

### 5.2.1 Fixed Topology Challenges

The current ECARLM framework is designed for fixed-length inputs, which can be problematic for variable-length text data.

- **Variable-Length Inputs**: Handling inputs of different lengths may require padding or truncation, which can lead to information loss or inefficiency.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Capturing hierarchical linguistic structures (e.g., parse trees) is not straightforward in the current linear cell arrangement.

Potential Solution: Developing dynamic topologies that can adapt to input complexity could address this limitation.

### 5.2.2 Discrete State Limitations

While the discrete state representation in ECARLM has advantages, it also presents challenges.

- **Granularity Trade-off**: There's a trade-off between the granularity of the state space and computational efficiency. Too few states may not capture nuanced information, while too many can lead to computational inefficiency.

- **Continuous Phenomena**: Some linguistic phenomena, such as semantic similarity, are naturally continuous and may be challenging to represent in a discrete state space.

Potential Solution: Exploring hybrid approaches that combine discrete and continuous representations could mitigate this limitation.

### 5.2.3 Optimal Evolution Steps

Determining the optimal number of evolution steps is a significant challenge in ECARLM.

- **Task Dependency**: The ideal number of steps can vary greatly depending on the specific task and input characteristics.

- **Overfitting Risk**: Too many evolution steps might lead to overfitting on specific patterns in the training data.

- **Computational Trade-off**: More evolution steps increase computational cost, so there's a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Potential Solution: Developing adaptive stopping criteria or meta-learning approaches to automatically determine the optimal number of steps could address this issue.

### 5.2.4 Rule Design Complexity

Creating comprehensive and effective rule sets for ECARLM can be challenging and time-consuming.

- **Expert Knowledge**: Designing rules often requires significant linguistic expertise and domain knowledge.

- **Rule Interactions**: As the rule set grows, understanding and managing the interactions between different rules becomes increasingly complex.

- **Completeness vs. Efficiency**: There's a tension between creating a complete set of rules to handle all cases and maintaining computational efficiency.

Potential Solution: Developing techniques for automated rule learning or rule optimization could help mitigate this challenge.

### 5.2.5 Handling Ambiguity and Uncertainty

Natural language is inherently ambiguous, and handling this ambiguity in a discrete, rule-based system can be challenging.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Unlike probabilistic models, ECARLM in its basic form doesn't naturally handle uncertainty or provide confidence scores for its outputs.

- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Resolving linguistic ambiguities often requires complex reasoning that may be difficult to capture with local rules.

Potential Solution: Incorporating probabilistic elements into the ECARLM framework or developing methods to maintain multiple hypotheses throughout the evolution process could help address this limitation.

In conclusion, while ECARLM offers significant advantages in terms of interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability, it also faces important challenges that need to be addressed. Ongoing research in areas such as dynamic topologies, hybrid models, and automated rule learning has the potential to overcome many of these limitations, making ECARLM a promising approach for future NLP systems.

# 6. Future Directions
