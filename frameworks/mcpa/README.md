# Modular Context Protocol Architecture (MCPA)

MCPA is a next-generation framework for LLMs that extends Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) with specialized protocols for advanced reasoning. It integrates the strengths of existing frameworks (Fractal, METRICS+, ECARLM, ELSF) while introducing standardized interfaces for context management, tool orchestration, and multimodal reasoning.

## Core Components

- **Protocol Layer**: Standardized protocols for context exchange, tool orchestration, and modality bridging
- **Processing Modules**: Specialized reasoning components activated based on task requirements
- **Integration System**: Coordinates module activation and maintains shared state
- **Execution Environment**: Manages tools, evaluation, and resource allocation

## Key Features

- Seamless integration with MCP architecture
- Modular, extensible design
- Support for advanced reasoning patterns
- Native multimodal integration
- Standardized tool orchestration
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

- [mcpa_framework.md](mcpa_framework.md) - Comprehensive documentation of the MCPA framework
- `protocols/` (coming soon) - Protocol specifications and implementations
- `modules/` (coming soon) - Processing module implementations
- `examples/` (coming soon) - Example usage scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

The MCPA implementation will proceed in three phases:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Protocol layer and integration system
2. **Module Implementation**: Processing modules and execution environment
3. **Integration and Testing**: MCP integration and evaluation

## Related Frameworks

MCPA integrates concepts from multiple existing frameworks:

- **Fractal Framework**: Multi-scale reasoning approach
- **METRICS+**: Layered analytical process with emotional intelligence
- **ECARLM**: State-based processing with uncertainty quantification
- **ELSF**: Formal logic integration and synthesis
- **ERTS**: Hierarchical tagging for instruction parsing
