PROMPT:
Create a detailed outline for a longform article based on the following information:

Title: 
Summary:
Target Audience:
Tone:
Key Points:
SEO Keywords:

Ensure the outline incorporates the key points and aligns with the target audience and tone. Use the SEO keywords naturally throughout the outline where appropriate. The outline should provide a clear roadmap for writing a comprehensive article on this topic. If any of the above fields are blank, intuitively fill those gaps.

Please present the outline without any introductory or concluding text, starting directly with the outline structure.
