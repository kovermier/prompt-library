## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a curated library of prompting techniques organized into categories for different use cases, featuring our revolutionary **Vibecoding System** - eight archetypal personas distilled from 29 philosophical paradigms that transform AI interaction through concentrated wisdom. Each component is structured with clear metadata and content, designed for immediate use or customization. Our goal is to move beyond mechanical prompt templates toward genuinely meaningful human-AI collaboration.

### ✨ **The Vibecoding Advantage**

Unlike traditional prompt engineering that focuses on optimization techniques, our **Eight Essential Archetypes** provide philosophical depth that creates genuinely different approaches to AI interaction:

- **🏛️ Clarity Architect** - Structural simplicity through fortress-like clarity
- **🪞 Direct Mirror** - Immediate insight without conceptual distortion  
- **🎼 Flow Director** - Dynamic harmony through structured improvisation
- **🔬 Truth Builder** - Foundational rigor through systematic validation
- **🕸️ Pattern Synthesizer** - Holistic integration revealing emergent understanding
- **🌱 Wisdom Guide** - Ethical integration honoring long-term harmony
- **🎨 Creative Organizer** - Aesthetic function making complexity beautiful
- **🔍 Purpose Seeker** - Authentic discovery through heart-centered inquiry

Each archetype represents genuine fusion of multiple wisdom traditions, creating capabilities impossible through individual approaches. Users select based on natural resonance rather than learning complex categorization systems.

### ✨ Vibecoding: The Eight Essential Archetypes

Our flagship innovation transforms AI interaction from mechanical prompt engineering into philosophical art. Eight archetypal personas, each representing fusion of multiple wisdom traditions, provide complete coverage of human-AI communication needs.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Philosophical Fusion Power** - Each archetype synthesizes 3+ wisdom traditions into capabilities impossible through individual approaches
- **Archetypal Resonance Selection** - Users choose based on natural resonance rather than learning complex categorization systems  
- **Anti-Template Approach** - Living principles that generate appropriate communication for any context rather than rigid structures
- **Elegant Scalability** - Works for both simple single-archetype focus and sophisticated multi-archetype combinations

### 🔄 Modular Context Protocol Architecture (MCPA)

Our conceptual framework extends Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) with specialized protocols for advanced reasoning. It provides standardized interfaces for context management, tool orchestration, and multimodal reasoning while integrating strengths from our other frameworks.

Key features:
- Protocol-driven context exchange
- Modular processing components
- Seamless tool integration
- Native multimodal reasoning
- Comprehensive evaluation methodology

Documentation: [frameworks/mcpa/mcpa_framework.md](frameworks/mcpa/mcpa_framework.md)

### 🧩 Enhanced Recursive Tagging System (ERTS)

The ERTS framework provides a structured way to create prompts using a hierarchical tagging system. It organizes instructions into categories with a specific syntax for easy LLM interpretation.

Example ERTS tag: `{Category: [Subcategory]<Attributes>}`

Documentation: [frameworks/prompt-structure/erts.md](frameworks/prompt-structure/erts.md)

### 📊 METRICS+

A layered analytical framework that processes information through multiple perspectives:
1. Direct Analysis (explicit requirements)
2. Meta Analysis (assumptions and biases)
3. Pattern Recognition (cross-domain patterns)
4. Knowledge Integration (research and experience)
5. Emotional Processing (human factors)

Documentation: [frameworks/metricsplus/metrics_plus_framework.md](frameworks/metricsplus/metrics_plus_framework.md)

### 🌀 Fractal Framework

A multi-scale approach to problem-solving that analyzes challenges at three levels:
- Macro Scale: Overall cognitive architecture
- Meso Scale: Component-level analysis
- Micro Scale: Implementation details

Documentation: [frameworks/fractal/fractal_framework.md](frameworks/fractal/fractal_framework.md)

### 🧠 Context Engineering & ADHD Optimization

Revolutionary approaches that transform prompts into dynamic, efficient context fields:

**Context Engineering**: Treats the context window as a neural field where information can be:
- Minimized to essential elements (80-90% token reduction)
- Structured as attractors and repulsors
- Designed for emergent understanding
- Measured and optimized continuously

**ADHD Prompting**: Optimizes for cognitive constraints shared by humans and LLMs:
- Visual anchors with emojis for quick scanning
- Front-loaded critical information
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Explicit state management

## 🤖 Using with Claude Code

This library is optimized for use with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's official CLI tool:

### Integration Tips

1. **Repository Context**: Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` for repository-specific instructions and conventions
2. **Search Integration**: Use the search tools to find relevant prompts before asking Claude to create new ones
3. **Prompt Discovery**: Ask Claude to search the library first: *"Search for existing automation prompts before creating new ones"*
4. **Framework Application**: Reference specific frameworks: *"Apply the METRICS+ framework to analyze this data"*
5. **Archetype Selection**: Use vibecoding archetypes: *"Respond as the Truth Builder archetype for this analysis"*

### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Search for existing solutions
./search -r "your task description"

# 2. If found, use existing prompts
# 3. If creating new prompts, update index
./update-index

# 4. Use Claude Code with library context
claude-code --model claude-3-5-sonnet
```

### Claude Code Best Practices

- **Reference Library**: Always check existing prompts before requesting new ones
- **Follow Conventions**: Use the YAML frontmatter format and naming conventions
- **Update Index**: Run `./update-index` after adding/modifying prompts

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

1. **Getting Started with Vibecoding**:
   - Begin with the [Vibecoding System Overview](tasks/vibecoding/README.md)
   - Use the [Quick Reference Guide](tasks/vibecoding/quick-reference.md) for archetype selection
   - Choose archetypes based on resonance with your current need and personal style
   - Experiment with single archetypes before exploring fusion combinations

2. **Adding New Prompts**: 
   - Place the prompt in the appropriate category folder under `tasks/`
   - For traditional persona-based prompts, place them in the relevant task category (e.g., `tasks/coding/personas/`)
   - Consider whether your prompt would benefit from vibecoding archetypal approach
   - Use the template format with YAML front matter
   - Follow naming conventions: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `react-developer.md`)

3. **Updating Existing Prompts**:
   - Update the 'updated' date in the YAML front matter
   - Increment the version number if making significant changes
   - Document major changes in the commit message

4. **Applying Systems**:
   - **For Vibecoding**: Start with archetypal resonance, experiment with fusions for complex needs
   - **For Traditional Frameworks**: Study documentation thoroughly, use provided templates, combine for complex use cases
   - **Integration**: Consider how vibecoding archetypes might enhance traditional framework applications
